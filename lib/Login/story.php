$story[0] = 'After unceasing wars between the various races, the cluster of galaxies in the known corner of the universe became uninhabitable. Severe solar storms swept through the trade lanes crushing any resources in the ravaged waste land and destroying any ship that did not get out of the way. Whole worlds were laid to waste between the frenzied fighting for the last remaining habitable areas and the harsh magnetic storms that stripped atmospheres in a matter of months.';
$story[1] = 'In a last desperate bid, what remained of the Galactic Council convinced several leaders of each race that it was time to flee the galaxy cluster and search for new homes. Seven races left with the council in search of a new home, while the rest remained to try and rebuild. After years of searching several members of each race, now fed up with the councils lack of leadership, left the relative safety of the council\'s fleet. Two years passed and still no home had been found.  The members who left looking for their own place in the universe have still not been heard from.<br />';
$story[2] = 'It is here where we find ourselves now. The traveling fleet of the council has decided to setup a temporary headquarters and give the races rest.  The leaders of the races agreed with the council and setup their own bases and former businessmen of the races setup trading ports and shops of every kind.  This caused great dissent among many members of the council, who then left to form a new government calling themselves "The Underground".  With this split in the council, the remaining members of the council decided change was needed.  They started by changing their name to the "Federal Government of the Seven". Within hours of the bases being setup, the new government began to receive several distress messages.  Concerned that these messages might be part of their fleet they immediately sent out scout vessels with heavily armed escorts to all five distress calls.<br />';
$story[3] = 'The first convoy reported back with excitement.  They had found the Nijarin fleet who had left the old galaxy shortly after the rest of the races and had been trying to contact them for sometime.  The Nijarins gladly joined the federal fleet and thus the Federal Government of the Seven became the Federal Government of the Eight.<br />';
$story[4] = 'The report from the second convoy was just as exciting.  They had found inhabitable planets, some of which had thriving communities.<br />';
$story[5] = 'The third convoy, the strongest that the council sent out reported back with grim news.  This is the only message received by the council: "This is convo... avo...der atta... they call them... Ere...s... they... too stron... don... ckup... repeat, do not... backup."  <br />';
$story[6] = 'The fourth and fifth convoys have yet to report back in.<br /><br />';
$story[7] = 'Space Merchant Realms is a game of skill and strategy. Top rank isn\'t always determined by your skills at trading or fighting, but also by your ability to command, negotiate, and cooperate with your fellow alliancemates and other players. Those that can successfully do this can consider themselves some of the best players Space Merchant Realms has to offer. ';
