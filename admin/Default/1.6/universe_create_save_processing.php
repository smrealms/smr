	<br />
	1) When you log off, always make sure you are safe, current sector will have a message if you are protected.<br />
	2) Don\'t raid ports.<br />
	3) Do not create more than one account.<br />
	4) Talk to other players ingame or in IRC chat.<br />
	5) Stay in the racial galaxies as much as possible.<br />
	6) Learn to use Merchant\'s Guide to the Universe.<br />
	7) Contact Newbie Help Leader for help, advice or with any questions you have.<br />

	<br />
	1) Access to one or more experienced veteran players who will give you accurate and unbiased advice. Most players in SMR will help you if you need it, but the veterans in this alliance are here specifically to help you.<br />
	<br />
	2) An extensive alliance message board with all the basics you need to know. Alliance members are encouraged to use the message board to ask their own questions - if you are wondering about something, chances are that other new players would like to know the answer too.<br />
	<br />
	3) Maps. A short time into every game, this alliance will usually have full maps of the game universe. However, keep in mind that maps will change slightly during the course of a game as ports get upgraded and busted down.<br />
	<br />
	4) If you stay in NHA, stay active, try to learn, and keep in touch with the Newbie Help Leader then this alliance can be a stepping stone to the more established alliances. Every game I get alliance leaders asking me to recommend newbies who are active and have potential.<br />
	<br />
	5) Newbie Help Leader will work with each of you individually on specific questions and game goals if you want. If resources allow it (I am dependent on my own trading income for cash) I try to reward players for achieving the game goals they work towards. I also try to make sure that members have at least a mid-level tradeship after they have been killed, although I try to make sure that they have learned from their mistakes before buying replacement ships (to be fair to the rest of the players in the game, you can no longer get cash or new ships after reaching fledgling status, although you are welcome to stay in the alliance as long as you like).';

One of the keys to success in the game is good turn management, no matter what you are busing the turns to accomplish. If you are a trader, you want to get as much cash and xp as possible per turn used. If you are a hunter, you want to spend as many turns as possible efficiently locating targets and getting kills, and as few as possible chasing traders around without getting the final trigger shot off. In an alliance, you will often be expected to save turns for op\'s, where it is often crucial to have plenty of alliance members show up with plenty of turns.<br />
	<br />
	Turns are accumulated constantly, whether you are logged in or not, and are a product of ship speed and game speed. When you click the Trader link on the left of your screen, one of the things you will see is how many turns you get per hour in the ship you are in, and also the maximum number of turns you can accumulate in the current game. It is important to manage your turns carefully - make sure to always leave yourself enough turns to get back to somewhere you can park safely (preferably with some to spare in case you run into trouble on the way). It can sometimes be a good idea to save up a large number of turns so you can use them all in one session, but be aware that this is not always possible or even ideal. You should try to avoid reaching the maximum number of turns, since you will then stop getting more and will basically be wasting the turns you would usually have accumulated.<br />
	<br />
	A good way to get a few extra turns and help the game at the same time is to click on the voting links at the bottom of your screen. Voting for SMR helps our rankings, which brings more players to the game - making it better for all of us.';

	<br />
	The basic idea of trading is that you buy goods from a port that sells them, transport them to a reciprocal port that buys them, and sell them there for a profit. If you make a good trade, you will also accumulate experience points for the trades. Reciprocal ports for a trade good are ones which can be matched up to create a trade route; for example if a port sells wood then all ports that buy wood are reciprocal ports and can potentially be used to create a "wood" traderoute. A good traderoute is one which can be traded in both directions (different goods of course), and one which makes good profits and/or experience. More on that later.<br />

	There are 12 tradegoods on the game, divided into low mid and high level goods. Three of the tradegoods are so-called illegals and can only be traded if your alignment in -100 or lower. The low level goods are wood, food, ore, precious metals and slaves (illegal); the mid levels are machinery, textiles, circuitry and weapons (illegal); and the high level goods are computers, luxury items and narcotics (illegal). Generally speaking, higher level goods are more rare, and will lead to better profits and often more experience points.<br />
	<br />
	The value and efficiency of a traderoute between 2 (or more) ports is determined by the multipliers for the goods traded, where the multipliers are determined by the distance to the nearest reciprocal port (note that the port you are actually using is irrelevant, it is the nearest port that counts). For example, if a port is buying computers from me and the nearest port selling computers is 3 sectors away then the multiplier for selling those comps is 3x. The multiplier determines the profit you will make and the maximum experience you can gain, the higher the multiplier, the better the trade. <br />
	<br />
	The experience you get from a trade depends on your relations with that race, and on how good a deal you make. With perfect relations (1000) you will automatically be offered the best possible deal by a port and will not need to bargain at all. At less than 1000 relations, you get experience depending on how well you bargain, where bargaining means offering a little less than the port asks for when you are buying and asking for a little more than the port is offering when you are selling. relations go up with successful trades, and they go down when a port refuses the bargain you offer them. If you are trading with your own race, it is often a good idea not to worry too much about making the best bargains at first and try to get maximum relations as quickly as possible.<br />
	<br />
	One of the major contributing factors to how well you can trade is the ship you are using. Profit and experience depend on the number of goods you are able to trade which depends in turn on the number of cargo holds you have and the speed of your ship. A general guide to how efficient a tradeship is is to multiply the number of holds by the ship speed to give you the trade potential. It is important to note, however, that trade potential is not the only important factor in choosing a tradeship. For example, the planetary super freighter is a very efficient trader with good defenses but is very slow and therefore very inefficient if you have to travel a lot between traderoutes and parking spots; whereas the Interstellar trader has pretty good trade potential and a jump drive to allow you to travel easily but has very weak defenses and is easily killed.';

	$text = 'This topic is extensive, and there is no substitute for playing the game, probably dying a few times, and learning through experience. However, it doesn\'t hurt to keep a few tips and tricks in mind:<br />
	<br />
	1) Choose your route. The best routes are also likely to be the least safe, since that is where most hunters will look for their targets. It is sometimes better to trade a slightly less lucrative route and stay alive, especially if you know there are hunters online in the area or you have seen a lot of deaths in the news on the better routes.<br />
	<br />
	2) Vary your trading. Good hunters will look for trading patterns and use them to catch their prey. Try to vary your trading times and your traderoutes to stay unpredictable.<br />
	<br />
	3) Use forces. If you have a ship that is force capable (i.e. a ship that can carry scouts, drones and/or mines), you should always use them when you trade. Ideally, you should have a scout+mine combo in your port sectors, and sometimes also other scouts and mines strategically placed around and along your route. The advantage of the scout+mine combo is that it warns you when someone enters your sector, plus it makes intruders load an extra screen before they can get to target you. If you see a scout message icon (top right of screen) you should immediately hit current sector, immediately run if you see a ship that was not there before (do not stop to examine it), run a few sectors to get clear, then get to safety if necessary.<br />
	<br />
	Always pick up your forces when you are done trading, and use just scouts or just mines if your ship can only carry those.<br />
	<br />
	4) Watch the CPL. Before and during trading, kepp an eye on the current player list and the news, and look for hunters who you think may come for you. It is sometimes better to ;eave trading for another time, but at least stay alive.<br />
	<br />
	5) Use local map. It can sometimes be useful to enter your port sectors using local map, especially if you suspect there may be trouble close by. This allows you to see ships sitting in neighbouring sectors waiting to ambush you, but it only works if you have a scanner.';

	<br />
	Scanners can warn you of nearby ships on local map (see safe trading thread).<br />
	<br />
	Scanners can warn you of cloaked ships. Scanning a sector (from a neighbouring sector) will give you a reading on the number of ships there. Enemy ships scan as their defensive value x 10. For example, if you scan a sector and get a reading of 300, then enter and see only a planetary super freighter there (def value of 15) then you know there is a 150 scan unaccounted for, which means a cloaked ship. At this point, you will probably want to get out of there fast! (Note that ship scans can sometimes also be off due to Illusion generator ships pretending to be something they are not).<br />
	<br />
	Scanners will give you force readings. Scanning a neighbouring sector will tell you the total number of forces in the sector (scouts scan as 1, drones as 2, mines as 3). This allows you to avoid sectors with heavy force scans (which usually means a lot of mines) when navigating.';

In addition to the neutral ships, each race also has unique ships that only race members can purchase. You can find the SMR shiplist here:<br />	
	<br />
	<a href="http://www.smrealms.de/manual.php?52">http://www.smrealms.de/manual.php?52</a><br />
	<br />
	It is important to choose ships to match your budget and your needs, and the biggest or most expensive ships are not always the best ones for all purposes.<br />
	<br />
	Make sure you are buying the right ship before you hand over your cash to the ship dealer since you only get a partial refund for the ship you are selling, which means that you lose some money every time you switch ships.<br />
	<br />
	Ships fall into a few basic categories, and I will try to give you a basic overview here - but I encourage everyone to look at the shiplist themselves, experiment with different ships, and talk to experienced players about what they recommend buying.<br />
	<br />
	Trade ships: This class of ships emphasizes trading capacity over fighting ability. They generally tend to be relatively slow, have good cargo capacity, very limited combat ability, and varying defense. These ships are basically only used for trading, and should run from pretty much any fight.<br />
	<br />
	Warships: These are the largest and most heavily armed ships in the game, and are ideal for combat situations where you expect someone (other ships) or something (ports and planets) to be firing back at you. This class of ships inculdes the racial warships and the Federal Ultimatum.<br />
	<br />
	Hunting ships: These combat vessels are slightly smaller than the warships but are usually faster and have the added ability to carry scout drones for gathering information and tracking other ships. Hunters are useful for killing tradeships or other hunters, but should generally avoid combat with warships.<br />
	<br />
	In addition to these basic classes, many ships are especially good at specific things like clearing mines, transporting forces or exploring the universe.<br />
	<br />
	Some of the ship concepts you should be familiar with:<br />
	- Cost. Unless you have a lot of spare cash, buy a ship to suit your budget. The most expensive ship is not always the best choice, especially if buying it leaves you with no cash reserves.<br />
	- Defense. Ship defense is made up of shields, armour and combat drones. The higher the defense, the harder you are to kill so more is better.<br />
	- Offensive capability. Ships attack (and defend) using weapons and combat drones. Weapons are mounted on the limited number of hardpoints (HP) a ship has, meaning that more HPs give a higher offensive capability.<br />
	- Speed. Ship speed determines how fast your ship will accumulate turns. Faster ships gain more turns per hour and vice versa.<br />
	- Hardware. Most ships can use one or more hardware items, each of which adds certain capabilities to the ship. These are Scanners (see scanner thread), Cloaks (invisibility from lower ranked traders when activated), Illusion Generators (the ability to disguise your ship), Jump Drives (allows you to jump from place to place without travelling through the sectors between), and Drone Scramblers (improved defense against combat drones).<br />
	- Restricted ships. There are restrictions on who can buy certain ships. These include racial restrictions, top racial restrictions (the top racial ships cannot be purchased until you reach fledgling status), and alignment restrictions (Underground and Federal ships require you to be evil or good respectively, Federal ships also take half damage from forces).';

	There are a few things to consider when choosing weapons, and the weapon combination that works for one player may not be suited to the style or the needs of another.<br />
	<br />
	- Cost. If your resources are limited (especially if you need to sell your weapons each time you log off) then buying the expensive big guns is not always the best choice. If you shop around, you can often get decent firepower relatively cheaply.<br />
	- Damage type. Weapon damage is classified by armour/shield damage, and a good weapon setup generally has these pretty evenly balanced. However, be aware that it is sometimes preferable to load up on weapons with a specific damage type in specific circumstances (for example, forces are killed by armour damage weapons so these are preferable for mineclearing).<br />
	- Accuracy. Weapon accuracy (modified by trader level) determines how likely it is that your weapon will hit your target on any shot. In ship to ship combat, higher ranked traders get accuracy benefits over their lower ranked opponents. There is (and always has been since the dawn of this game) an ongoing debate about when it is better to use either high accuracy low damage weapons or low accuracy high damage weapons.<br />
	- Rating. There are restrictions on how many weapons of certain ratings you are allowed to arm yourself with. Weapon rating is determined by accuracy and damage, and higher is better. You are allowed up to one level 5 weapon, up to 2 level 4 weapons, and up to 3 level 3 weapons.<br />
	- Availability.Weapon choice when arming is sometimes determined by the availability of certain weapons. Racial weapons are only available to the owner race or races that have peaceful relations with them; weapons may be sold at weapon shops that are not safely accessible; or the number of turns it would take to acquire all the weapons you would like may be too high.';

	$db->query('REPLACE INTO alliance_thread_topic (game_id, alliance_id, thread_id, topic) VALUES ('.$gameID.', 302, 24, \'Planets and Terrritory\')');
	$text = 'Except for your ship and what it carries, a planet is the only thing in SMR that you can claim for yourself or your alliance. This means that planets and planet galaxies are often the main focus of the rivalries and wars between alliances.<br />
	<br />
	At the beginning of every game planets are weak and planet galaxies are easily accessible, but as a game progresses planets become stronger (the strongest planets will regularly kill attacking warships even when being attacked by a full fleet) and some galaxies (alliance territory) become heavily fortified by minefields. Planets become parking spots for fully armed warships as well as being used to generate cash, and therefore become attractive targets for enemy alliances.<br />
	<br />
	Kill counts and experience are important measures of success, but many veteran players feel that the only true measure of success in alliance wars is the ability to hold and/or take territory from enemy alliances.<br />
	<br />
	It is important to note that weakly defended planets should NOT be considered safe parking spots.';
