 *
 * The lock creates exclusive access to a specified sector, since that is
 * the primary way (caveat: but not the _only_ way) in which simultaneous
 * processing would create inconsistencies.
 *
 * There are more elegant solutions to this problem (such a row-level
 * locking within the database). There are also some deficiencies in this
 * implementation, in particular the inability for a single player to lock
 * two sectors at once (to avoid, e.g., race conditions with movement).
