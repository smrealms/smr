	You have received this page because you are almost out of newbie turns.
	What does this mean? You can now do many things that you couldn't do while in newbie turns.
</p>

<ol>You can...
	<li>Attack other players</li>
	<li>Attack enemy planets</li>
	<li>Port raid</li>
	<li>Deploy forces</li>
</ol>

<p>But remember, with the good comes the bad.</p>

<ol>You can...
	<li>Be attacked</li>
	<li>Hit enemy forces and take damage</li>
	<li>die...</li>
</ol>

<p>Plan for your safety now! Remember to use Federal protection (you may need to disarm before authorities will protect you, depending on your alignment, and you won't be protected by a race you are at war with). You may also find safety on planets, if they are sufficiently fortified. Most importantly, watch out for the people looking for you.</p>
