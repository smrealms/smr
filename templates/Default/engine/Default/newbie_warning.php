	What does this mean? You can now do many things that you couldn't do while in newbie turns.
</p>

<ol>You can...
	<li>attack other players</li>
	<li>attack enemy planet\'s</li>
	<li>Port raid</li>
	<li>Place forces</li>
</ol>

<p>But remember, with the good comes the bad. In addition to being able to do the above, they can happen to you.</p>

<ol>You can...
	<li>Be Attacked</li>
	<li>Hit enemy forces and take damage</li>
	<li>die...</li>
</ol>

<p>Plan for your safety now. Remember to use federal protection (Must have an acceptable attack rating, this increases/decreases with your align so it is safest to have an attack rating of 0 if unsure, also make sure to stick to the federal space of friendly races), know where your alliances strongest planets are, and watch out for the people looking for you.</p>
