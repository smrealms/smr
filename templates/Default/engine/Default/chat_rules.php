These rules have been created for all chatters in #SMR. The purpose of #SMR is to have a general gathering of all players, newbies and vets, and anyone else who may decide to enter the channel. The channel is meant to help anyone with any questions or problems they may have regarding the game. The following is a list of the rules we ask that everyone follow:<br /><br />

		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>In extreme cases of severe and/or multiple offences long term bans will be issued.</li>
